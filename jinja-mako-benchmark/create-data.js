The sound of footsteps became louder every day, Then I noticed the fact there was no time.  I was a believer in life to be myself always, and was asking whether I would be alive.  Give me a reason why not to adopt in this way, or judge me to be guilty of so many incurable sins.  Tell me why,or why not.Complaining way too much, maybe I overlooked something fatal for me.

Now what? So what? Dont you come interrupt me, oh please while I am interrupting myself.'})
